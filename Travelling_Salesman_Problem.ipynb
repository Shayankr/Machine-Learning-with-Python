    "The code provided above is an **implementation of a genetic algorithm** to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Here is an overview of how the algorithm works and what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "    We start by generating a population of candidate solutions. Each solution is represented as an array of integers, where each integer represents a city that the salesman visits. The order of the integers in the array represents the order in which the cities are visited.\n",
    "    The population size is set to 50, which means that we generate 50 candidate solutions in the beginning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Evaluation:**\n",
    "    Once we have a population of candidate solutions, we need to evaluate how good each solution is. In the TSP, the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by the salesman.\n",
    "    To calculate the fitness of each candidate solution, we use the distance function, which takes an array of cities (in the order visited by the salesman) and returns the total distance traveled. The fitness of each solution is set to be the reciprocal of the distance, which means that better solutions have a higher fitness.\n",
    "    The fitness values are then normalized so that they sum up to 1. This allows us to use the fitness values as probabilities in the selection step.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Selection:**\n",
    "    The next step is to select the parents for the next generation of candidate solutions. We use a roulette wheel selection method, where each solution is selected with a probability proportional to its fitness value.\n",
    "    We randomly select two parents from the population using this method.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Crossover:**\n",
    "    Once we have selected the parents, we need to create offspring for the next generation. We use a crossover operator to create the offspring.\n",
    "    The crossover point is chosen randomly, and the two parents exchange the cities that come after the crossover point to create two offspring.\n",
    "    We repeat this step until we have generated 48 offspring.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Mutation:**\n",
    "    To add diversity to the population, we apply a mutation operator to some of the offspring. The mutation operator randomly swaps two cities in the offspring.\n",
    "    We apply this mutation operator to 5% of the offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Elitism:**\n",
    "    We want to preserve the best solution from the previous generation in the next generation, so we use elitism to do this. We copy the best solution from the previous generation to the new generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Replacement:**\n",
    "    Finally, we replace the old population with the new population, which consists of the offspring and the elite solution from the previous generation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. **Repeat:**\n",
    "    We repeat this process for a fixed number of generations (in this case, 200).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the 200 generations are complete, the best solution is returned, which represents the shortest tour found by the algorithm."

    "It is possible to use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). \n",
    "    Here is an overview of how PSO works for TSP:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1 Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    We start by generating a population of candidate solutions. Each solution is represented as an array of integers, where each integer represents a city that the salesman visits. The order of the integers in the array represents the order in which the cities are visited.\n",
    "    We also initialize a swarm of particles, each of which has a position and velocity that represents a candidate solution to the TSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once we have a population of candidate solutions (in the form of particles), we need to evaluate how good each solution is. In the TSP, the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by the salesman.\n",
    "    To calculate the fitness of each particle, we use the distance function, which takes an array of cities (in the order visited by the salesman) and returns the total distance traveled. \n",
    "    The fitness of each particle is set to be the reciprocal of the distance, which means that better particles have a higher fitness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Velocity Update:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each particle updates its velocity using the following formula:\n",
    "   **v_i = w*v_i + c_1*r_1*(p_i-x_i) + c_2*r_2*(p_g-x_i)**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    where v_i is the velocity of particle i, \n",
    "    w is the inertia weight, c_1 and c_2 are the cognitive and social learning factors, \n",
    "    r_1 and r_2 are random numbers between 0 and 1, \n",
    "    p_i is the best solution found by particle i so far, \n",
    "    x_i is the current position of particle i, and \n",
    "    p_g is the best solution found by the entire swarm so far.\n",
    "This update formula incorporates the particle's own best position (p_i) and the best position found by the swarm (p_g) to guide the particle's movement towards better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Position Update:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each particle updates its position using the following formula:\n",
    "   **x_i = x_i + v_i**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    where x_i is the current position of particle i, and \n",
    "    v_i is the velocity of particle i.\n",
    "    This update formula moves the particle towards its updated velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Local Best Update:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Each particle updates its own best position (p_i) if its fitness is better than its current best position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Global Best Update:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The swarm updates the global best position (p_g) if any particle finds a better solution than the current global best position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Repeat:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    We repeat the velocity update, position update, and best updates for a fixed number of iterations (in this case, 200).\n",
    "After the iterations are complete, the best solution is returned, which represents the shortest tour found by the algorithm."
